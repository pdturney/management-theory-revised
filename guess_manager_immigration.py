# Guess Manager Immigration

# Peter Turney, August 10, 2021

# From the 20 runs, extract all of the pickled seeds with
# two, three, or four parts. Try to guess which part is
# the manager by running many one-on-one competitions
# between two parts. The part that wins the most competitions
# is the best guess for the manager.
