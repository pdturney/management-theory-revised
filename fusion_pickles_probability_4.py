# Fusion Pickles Probability 4 Parts
#
# Peter Turney, July 14, 2021
#
# From the 20 runs, extract all of the pickled four-part seeds
# that are stored in the 20 "fusion_storage.bin" pickle files.
# Read the pickles and run each pickle, recording the results in
# a numpy tensor:
#
# tensor = num_seeds x num_steps x num_colours x num_parts
#
# num_seeds   = to be determined
# num_steps   = 1001
# num_colours = 5 (white, red, orange, blue, green)
# num_parts   = 4
#
# After this tensor has been filled with values, generate
# a table of the form:
#
# <prob N M> = <probability for N managers and M workers>
#
# row in table = <step number> <prob 4 0> <prob 3 1> <prob 2 2> 
#                <prob 1 3> <prob 0 4>
